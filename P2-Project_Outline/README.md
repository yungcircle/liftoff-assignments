## Submission Instructions

### Overview
An app for managing book lending and borrowing, where
users across the country can go online and lend out their own collection
of books, rate other users based on how they treat the books,
request payment for damaged books or books not returned,
and the option to buy and sell books.
The idea came from wanting a place for people who love books
to have a place to buy, sell, trade/borrow and to discuss their
favorite titles/media.
